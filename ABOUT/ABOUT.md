# SagaMind: A Transaction-Safe Multi-Agent Runtime & Cognitive Memory Co-Processor
## Academic System Specification and Architectural Blueprint

---

### Abstract

This document presents the comprehensive architectural blueprint, mathematical foundations, and system specifications for **SagaMind**, an enterprise-grade, transaction-safe multi-agent runtime and cognitive memory co-processor. Designed to bridge the gap between stochastic neural model execution (System 1) and deterministic formal safety gates (System 2), SagaMind introduces a novel neuro-symbolic execution model. It leverages Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) via the Z3 theorem prover to guarantee execution safety, utilizes a transaction coordinator implementing the Saga pattern with LIFO compensation logic to preserve system consistency, and integrates a multi-layered cognitive co-processor based on Ebbinghaus memory decay and density-based experience consolidation. We provide detailed specifications of the runtime engine, mathematical derivations of the decay curves, formal invariants of the verification solver, and implementation outlines for deployment at scale.

## 1. Theoretical Framework & Epistemological Model

Autonomous agent architectures have historically struggled with the dual requirements of adaptive, creative problem-solving and strict operational safety. Standard cognitive architectures (e.g., SOAR, ACT-R) rely heavily on symbolic rule engines, which excel at deterministic validation but fail when confronted with open-ended, natural language objectives. Conversely, modern Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI) operate on stochastic token-prediction mechanisms, which are highly expressive but lack formal guarantees of correctness, transactional safety, or structural memory management.

SagaMind resolves this tension by implementing a **Neuro-Symbolic Dual-Process Cognitive Engine**, inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s dual-process theory:

*   **System 1 (Stochastic Reasoning)**: The LLM agent acts as the generative interface. It proposes steps, tools, and actions based on context and goals. However, the system never executes System 1 proposals directly on the production host.
*   **System 2 (Deterministic Guard rails)**: The formal validation gate. Every action proposal is converted into symbolic logical statements and checked against invariants using the Z3 theorem prover. If the solver proves that the execution invariants are satisfied (i.e., no safety violation is possible), the action is compiled and executed in a sandboxed WebAssembly (WASM) environment. If a safety boundary is violated, the step is rejected, and a compensation workflow is triggered to restore state consistency.

## 2. Global System Topology

SagaMind is structured as a decoupled, modular co-processor. The system is split into distinct layers managing verification, execution, short-term temporal memory, long-term semantic graphs, and speculative drafting.

## 3. Section 2 — Neuro-Symbolic Verification Engine (System 2)

The verification layer prevents agents from performing illegal actions (e.g., unauthorized file deletion, directory traversals, invalid numeric range updates, or SQL injection queries) by validating inputs against logic invariants.

### 3.1 Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) via Z3

When an agent proposes an action, it supplies:
1.  A set of runtime arguments, $A = \{k_1: v_1, k_2: v_2, \dots, k_n: v_n\}$.
2.  An invariant string, $I$, specified in SMT-LIB2 syntax or dynamic symbolic logic definitions.

The `Z3Verifier` compiles the arguments into typed Z3 variables based on their Python data type:
*   `str` $\to$ `z3.String(key)`
*   `bool` $\to$ `z3.Bool(key)`
*   `int` or `float` $\to$ `z3.Real(key)`

The verifier asserts that the parameters match their runtime values:
$$\forall k_i \in A, \quad z3\_var(k_i) = val(v_i)$$

The verifier then asserts the *negation* of the safety invariant:
$$\Phi = \neg I$$

The solver checks the combined formula for satisfiability:
$$\text{result} = \text{Solve}(\Phi \land \bigwedge_{i=1}^n z3\_var(k_i) == val(v_i))$$

*   **`UNSATISFIABLE (UNSAT)`**: There is no assignment of variables that can satisfy the negation of the invariant. Therefore, the safety invariant **cannot be violated** under any condition for these arguments. The action is marked as **Formally Safe** and approved for execution.
*   **`SATISFIABLE (SAT)`**: The solver successfully finds a counter-example where the safety invariant is violated. The counter-example model is extracted, logged as an error, and the action is rejected.

### 3.2 Formal Directory Traversal Proof

A core vulnerability of autonomous agents is directory traversal (e.g., the agent tries to write to `../../etc/passwd` or outside the designated workspace).

Let the authorized workspace root be $W_{root}$ (e.g., `/app/workspace`). Let the file path argument proposed by the agent be $P$.

The safety invariant is defined as:
$$I = \text{PrefixOf}(W_{root}, P)$$

The verifier checks the formula:
$$\Phi = \text{Not}(\text{PrefixOf}(W_{root}, P)) \land (P == \text{Val}(v_{path}))$$

If the path string contains traversal segments (e.g. `/app/workspace/../../etc/passwd`), Z3's string logic solver evaluates the prefix matching rules of SMT-LIB. Since the resolved path doesn't begin with the prefix $W_{root}$, the formula evaluates to **SAT** (a violation exists), and the step is rejected.

### 3.3 Dynamic Invariant Parsing & Fallbacks

If the Z3 library is not loaded on the host platform due to runtime container limits, the verifier falls back to a deterministic semantic parser. For example, for file path safety:

$$\text{is\_safe} = P.\text{startswith}(W_{root}) \land \text{".."} \notin P$$

This ensures that the application degrades gracefully to a standard regex/string gate if formal solvers are absent.

## 4. Transactional Agent Runtime (Saga Engine)

When executing multi-step agent workflows (e.g., deploying code, updating multiple tables, sending notifications), it is critical that the system remains consistent even if a step midway through the transaction fails. SagaMind implements a transactional coordinator based on the **Saga Pattern**.

```
Saga Execution Flow:
Step 1: Execute (Write File)   ──► Step 2: Execute (Db Query) ──► Step 3: Failure (Docker Build Fail)
                                                                            │
┌───────────────────────────┐      ┌───────────────────────────┐            │
│ Step 1 Comp. (Delete File)│ ◄──  │ Step 2 Comp. (Rollback DB)│ ◄──────────┘
└───────────────────────────┘      └───────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.1 The Saga Protocol

A Saga is represented as a sequence of steps $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_m$, where each step $S_i$ consists of:
1.  An execution action, $A_i$.
2.  A compensating action, $C_i$, which undoes the effects of $A_i$ in case of failure.

The Saga guarantees **backward recovery**: if step $S_k$ fails (where $1 \le k \le m$), the engine halts execution and executes the compensating actions in **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order:
$$C_k, C_{k-1}, \dots, C_1$$

### 4.2 Step State Transitions

The execution state transitions of a SagaStep are modeled as a finite state machine:

```
                  ┌──────────────┐

                                             │ROLLED_BACK │
                                             └────────────┘
```

*   **`PENDING`**: Step is initialized, waiting for execution slot.
*   **`RUNNING`**: The verifier has cleared the step, and it is executing inside the WASM sandbox.
*   **`COMMITTED`**: Execution completed successfully, returning state updates.
*   **`FAILED`**: The execution threw an exception, timed out, or violated a Z3 safety invariant.
*   **`ROLLED_BACK`**: The corresponding compensation action $C_i$ was successfully executed.

### 4.3 Handling Compensation Failures

If a compensating action $C_i$ itself fails (e.g. network failure during DB rollback), the engine cannot automatically proceed. The Saga coordinator intercepts the failure, logs the detailed error stack, marks the step status as `FAILED`, and raises a critical alert. This stops the automated flow, preventing cascade corruption and signaling human operators to perform manual intervention.

## 5. Cognitive Co-Processor Memory Architecture

Human cognition relies on short-term sensory memory, mid-term episodic experiences, and long-term abstract semantic schemas. SagaMind implements a three-tier cognitive memory architecture.

```

### 5.1 Ebbinghaus Memory Decay

To prevent the agent's context window from being flooded with irrelevant details, memory recall uses the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**. 

Let $t$ be the time elapsed (in hours) since the memory was created or last retrieved. The retention probability $R(t)$ is calculated as:
$$R(t) = e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}}$$

Where:
*   $S$ is the **Memory Strength** (retrievability factor).
*   $c$ is a constant scaling factor (default: $1.0$).

Memory Strength $S$ is calculated dynamically based on the memory's base importance score ($I_{base} \in [0.0, 1.0]$) and the number of times it has been recalled ($n_{access} \ge 0$):
$$S = I_{base} + \ln(1 + n_{access})$$

#### Mathematical Constraints:
1.  **Retention Limit**: $R(t) \in [0.0, 1.0]$. If $I_{base} = 0$, then $S = 0$, and the retention is instantly evaluated as $R(t) = 0$.
2.  **Access Reinforcement**: Each recall increment $n_{access} \to n_{access} + 1$ increases the denominator, slowing the decay rate (simulating the spacing effect in learning).
3.  **Active Threshold**: A memory node is considered **active** and returned to the LLM agent's context window only if its retention score is equal to or greater than the eviction threshold $\tau$ (default: $0.15$):
    $$R(t) \ge \tau$$
    If $R(t) < \tau$, the memory is evicted from short-term recall and must be retrieved from the long-term graph database.

### 5.2 Density-Based Experience Consolidation (Sleep Cycles)

Periodically, the system initiates a background consolidation cycle (analogous to sleep cycles) to cluster raw episodes and extract abstract concepts.

#### Step 1: Distance Calculation
Let $E = \{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_N\}$ be the set of episodic memories stored in TimescaleDB for a tenant. Each episode $e_i$ contains a high-dimensional vector embedding $\vec{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{1536}$ (e.g. OpenAI ada embeddings).
The distance between two memories is calculated using **Cosine Distance**:
$$d(e_i, e_j) = 1.0 - \frac{\vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_j}{\|\vec{v}_i\| \|\vec{v}_j\|}$$

#### Step 2: DBSCAN Clustering
The consolidation cycle uses a custom density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN style) to group similar experiences:
1.  Iterate through all episodes $e_i$. If $e_i$ is already assigned to a cluster, skip.
2.  Find all neighboring episodes $N_\epsilon(e_i)$ such that:
    $$N_\epsilon(e_i) = \{e_j \in E \mid d(e_i, e_j) \le \epsilon\}$$
3.  If $|N_\epsilon(e_i)| \ge \text{MinPts}$ (default: $2$), form a new cluster containing $e_i$ and all neighbors.
4.  Expand the cluster by scanning neighbors recursively. Mark episodes that do not fit into any cluster as noise (singletons).

#### Step 3: Graph Projection (Neo4j)
For each consolidated cluster $C_k$, the engine generates a summarized concept node (representing the core semantic theme of the cluster). It projects this concept into the Neo4j graph database:
*   Creates a `Concept` node: `(c:Concept {name: "Cluster K Concept"})`.
*   Draws directed semantic edges to the individual episodic memory summaries:
    `(c)-[:SUMMARIZES_EXPERIENCE {weight: 0.7}]->(summary)`
*   Draws directed edges linking the executing agent role to the concept:
    `(role)-[:DISCOVERED_CONCEPT {weight: 0.5}]->(c)`

This compresses hundreds of individual vector logs into a clean, queryable knowledge graph.

## 6. Copy-on-Write Sandboxing & Speculative Execution

To allow agents to safely plan complex actions before committing to production, SagaMind uses speculative sandboxing.

### 6.1 WASM Execution Engine

SagaMind's execution layer is designed to run user-submitted code in WebAssembly.
*   **AOT Compilation**: Input scripts are compiled into WebAssembly bytecode.
*   **System Call Interception**: Direct disk/network access is blocked. Disk accesses are mapped to a temporary directory under `ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and database queries are logged for validation rather than executed against the production database.

### 6.2 Speculative Orchestration

The `SpeculativeOrchestrator` allows agents to draft multiple execution paths in parallel:

```
                               ┌──► COW Sandbox A ──► State Hash A (Success)
                               │
Speculative Orches. ── Drafts ─┼──► COW Sandbox B ──► Access Violation (Rejection)
                               │
                               └──► COW Sandbox C ──► State Hash C (Success)
```

1.  The agent submits multiple draft command sets (e.g. alternative compilation steps or query paths).
2.  The speculative orchestrator spins up isolated Copy-on-Write (COW) overlay folders matching the host environment.
3.  Drafts are executed asynchronously in parallel.
4.  Each path returns a state diff hash and success code.
5.  If a path succeeds and is selected by the coordinator, its COW state overlay is merged/committed to the primary workspace environment. Rejected paths are deleted instantly.

---

## 7. Database Schemas & Physical Storage Mappings

SagaMind utilizes a dual database engine to model episodic and semantic memory.

### 7.1 TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) Schema Definition

Episodic memory records require relational database properties alongside vector indexes. The tables are configured as follows:

```sql
-- Enable vector extension for cosine similarity queries
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS episodic_memories (
    memory_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    last_retrieved_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    agent_role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    context_data JSONB,
    importance_score DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    retrieval_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    embedding VECTOR(1536)
);

-- Hypertable creation for Timescale time-series optimization
SELECT create_hypertable('episodic_memories', 'created_at', if_not_exists => TRUE);

-- HNSW Vector Index for low-latency cosine distance searches
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS episodic_memories_hnsw_idx 
ON episodic_memories USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

### 7.2 Neo4j Cypher Schema & Projection

Semantic schemas represent graph nodes of agents, tasks, and abstract concepts. The query patterns are:

```cypher
// Ensure unique concept indexes
CREATE CONSTRAINT concept_name FOR (c:Concept) REQUIRE c.name IS UNIQUE;

// Upsert relationship between a concept and its summarizing experiences
MERGE (s:Concept {name: $source})
MERGE (t:Concept {name: $target})
MERGE (s)-[r:RELATION {type: $relation}]->(t)
ON CREATE SET r.weight = $weight
ON MATCH SET r.weight = r.weight + (1.0 - r.weight) * 0.1;
```

## 8. Mathematical Proofs and Formal Specifications

### 8.1 Theorem 1: Path Traversal Prevention Invariant
**Goal**: Prove that no file write path $P$ can access a folder outside the authorized root directory $W_{root}$.

**Definitions**:
*   Let $\Sigma^*$ be the set of all string sequences.
*   Let the path string be $P \in \Sigma^*$. Let the authorized workspace root path be $W_{root} \in \Sigma^*$.
*   Let canonicalize function $C: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ resolve all relative paths (`..`, `.`, symlinks) into absolute filesystem representations.
*   Let prefix predicate $P_{ref}(A, B)$ be true if and only if string $A$ is a prefix of string $B$.

**Invariant**:
$$\forall P \in \Sigma^*, \quad \text{write\_file}(P) \implies P_{ref}(W_{root}, C(P))$$

**Proof by SMT Assertion**:
In the Z3 verifier, we assert the negation of the invariant:
$$\Phi = \text{Not}(P_{ref}(W_{root}, C(P)))$$

The solver is initialized with the constraint:
$$C(P) == v_{path}$$

If there exists any input $P$ that resolves such that $C(P)$ does not begin with $W_{root}$, the solver returns `SAT` with the violating path string as the model counter-example (e.g. $P = "/app/workspace/../../etc/passwd" \implies C(P) = "/etc/passwd"$). The verifier catches this model, returns `False`, and blocks execution before the file system API is called. Since the solver is sound and complete for string logic, traversal attacks are guaranteed to be blocked. $\blacksquare$

### 8.2 Theorem 2: Spaced Recall Memory Decay Limit
**Goal**: Prove that the memory retention probability $R(t)$ is non-increasing with respect to time $t$, and strictly increasing with respect to retrieval access count $n_{access}$.

**Formulation**:
$$R(t) = e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}} \quad \text{where } S = I_{base} + \ln(1 + n_{access}), \quad t \ge 0, \quad S > 0, \quad c > 0$$

**Part A: Derivative with respect to time $t$**:
$$\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{S \cdot c} e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}}$$

Since $S > 0$, $c > 0$, and the exponential term $e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}} > 0$:
$$\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} < 0 \quad \forall t \ge 0$$
Thus, memory retention is strictly decreasing over time.

**Part B: Derivative with respect to access count $n_{access}$**:
Using the chain rule:
$$\frac{\partial R}{\partial n_{access}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial S} \cdot \frac{\partial S}{\partial n_{access}}$$

$$\frac{\partial R}{\partial S} = \frac{t}{S^2 \cdot c} e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}} \ge 0 \quad (\text{since } t \ge 0)$$
$$\frac{\partial S}{\partial n_{access}} = \frac{1}{1 + n_{access}} > 0 \quad (\text{since } n_{access} \ge 0)$$

$$\frac{\partial R}{\partial n_{access}} = \left(\frac{t}{S^2 \cdot c(1 + n_{access})}\right) e^{-\frac{t}{S \cdot c}} \ge 0 \quad \forall t \ge 0$$
For any elapsed time $t > 0$, $\frac{\partial R}{\partial n_{access}} > 0$.
Thus, increasing access count increases retention score, proving that spaced retrievals reinforce memory. $\blacksquare$

## 11. Conclusion & Future Outlook

SagaMind establishes a new paradigm for autonomous agent architecture, proving that cognitive reasoning can be bound by formal safety contracts and transactional guarantees. By separating generation (System 1) from verification (System 2) and execution, the system achieves unprecedented stability, eliminating security risks like directory traversals and untracked file system corruptions.

Future iterations of SagaMind will expand the SMT verification layer to support more complex invariant structures, and integrate active learning loops to optimize the parameters of the Ebbinghaus memory decay system dynamically based on task completion rates.
